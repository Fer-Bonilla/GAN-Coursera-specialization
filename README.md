# coursera GAN specialization

In this repository, you can find the files and labs solved only for reference for the coursera GAN specialization, but I encourage you to solve the labs by yourself.

The GAN coursera specilization have 3 courses:

## Course1: Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- Week 1: Intro to GANs
- Week 2: Deep Convolutional GANs
- Week 3: Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty
- Week 4: Conditional GAN & Controllable Generation

## Course2: Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- Week 1: Evaluation of GANs
- Week 2: GAN Disadvantages and Bias
- Week 3: StyleGAN and Advancements

## Course 3: Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- Week 1: GANs for Data Augmentation and Privacy
- Week 2: Image-to-Image Translation with Pix2Pix
- Week 3: Unpaired Translation with CycleGAN
